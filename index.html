      <h2>What is C Programming Language?</h2>
      <p>C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely used. It is a very popular language, despite being very old. It is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who is the founder of C Programming Language?</h2>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> There is a programming language called ‘B’. B was developed at Bell Labs circa 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why Should We Learn C Programming?</h2>
      <h3>C is a Middle-Level Language</h3>
      <p>C is in between low-level and high-level languages. C can talk to machines and also help humans write logic. So, we can make both system software (like operating systems) and apps using C.</p>
      <p><strong>Low-level:</strong> like machine language or assembly language (only computers understand).<br>
         <strong>High-level:</strong> like Python or Java (easy for humans to read).</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Windows, Linux – parts of them are written in C.</p>

      <h3>C Helps Us Understand Computer Basics</h3>
      <p>Many important computer topics use C language like: Operating System, Computer Networks, Compiler, Computer Architecture. These need knowledge of C because it helps you understand how the computer really works.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you want to know how the CPU stores data in memory or how a computer sends messages over a network – C will help you.</p>

      <h3>Fewer Libraries in C = Better Practice</h3>
      <p>In modern languages (like Python), you just call ready-made functions. But in C, you write many things by yourself. This helps you think more, solve problems, and understand how programming really works.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> In Python, you can just write <code>sum(numbers)</code>. But in C, you write your own logic to add numbers – this helps you learn step-by-step thinking.</p>

      <h3>C is Very Fast</h3>
      <p>C programs run very fast because they go close to machine language. No extra help like automatic memory cleaning — you do it yourself.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you write a game or software where speed is very important, C is better than Python.</p>

      <h3>C is Used in Embedded Systems</h3>
      <p>C is used to control small computers inside devices like: Cars, Washing machines, Robots, Remote controls. This is called embedded programming.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a robot moves when it sees an object, its brain (microcontroller) may be running a C program.</p>

      <h3>C is the Mother of Many Languages</h3>
      <p>Languages like: C++, Java, Python, Go …they all use C-like syntax. If you learn C, it becomes much easier to learn these other languages later.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> C uses <code>{ }</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>for</code> – and so does Java, C++, etc.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> If you learn C, you will understand how computers really work. It will make you a smart and strong programmer.</p>

      <h2>Applications of C Programming Language (with Examples)</h2>

      <h3>1. Operating System Development</h3>
      <p>C is used to make operating systems that run our computers and phones. Because C is fast and can work directly with hardware like memory and CPU.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
      UNIX: One of the first operating systems, rewritten in C in the 1970s.<br>
      Linux: A popular operating system (used in servers, mobiles, and supercomputers), written mostly in C.<br>
      Other uses in OS: Making kernels, device drivers, and system tools.</p>

      <h3>2. Embedded Systems and IoT Devices</h3>
      <p>C is used to control small devices like remote controls, smart TVs, or car engines. Because C is lightweight and can run on devices with very little memory and power.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Cars: Engine control software is written in C. Smart homes: Devices like smart bulbs, fans, or thermostats run C code.</p>

      <h3>3. Compilers and Interpreters</h3>
      <p>C is used to make compilers and interpreters, which are tools that help run programs in other languages.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> GCC, Python Interpreter</p>

      <h3>4. Database Systems</h3>
      <p>C is used to build fast and powerful databases.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> MySQL, Oracle</p>

      <h3>5. Game Development and Graphics</h3>
      <p>C is used in creating video games and graphics tools.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Doom & Quake, OpenGL</p>

      <h3>6. Network Programming and Drivers</h3>
      <p>C is used in network tools and device drivers.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Wireshark, NGINX</p>

      <h3>7. System Utilities and Command-Line Tools</h3>
      <p>Many basic tools in computers are written in C.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> grep, GNU Core Utilities (like ls, cp, mv)</p>

      <h3>8. Scientific Research and High-Performance Computing (HPC)</h3>
      <p>Scientists use C to simulate planets, predict weather, or analyze data faster.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> GSL, LAPACK</p>

      <h2>What will you do after learning this language? What is your vision?</h2>
      <p>After learning C, you’ll be able to write fast and efficient programs, understand core computer science concepts, and be ready to learn other programming languages easily. You'll also be ready for embedded systems, OS development, and software engineering roles.</p>
